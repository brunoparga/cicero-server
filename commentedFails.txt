Regex to play with the main list: /(.*?\t.*?\t.*?) \((.+?)\t/

ERROR IS IN THE DB
gendered pronouns (e.g quīdam): lack gender attributes (same with numerals) (NumPronProps)
meminī, coepī: DB lacking correct perfect infinitive (fix in verb-property setter)
prosper: fix feminine and neuter (similar to next line)
-erī adjectives: feminine and neuter are wrong (tener, miser, līber, alter, asper)
dīves: listed as type I -er (WTF?)
alius: weird neuter (fix in NumPronProps)

ERROR IS IN THE STATE AND PRESENTATION
irregular verbs: correct infinitive is not shown so cannot match; DOM-inserting it works
fās, nefās: wrong declension presentation (indeclinable)
singulī: presentation is wrong (DB is right)

ERROR IS IN THE ACTION
is/e adjectives: guess.declension not being set to true with any option (let alone the right one)
