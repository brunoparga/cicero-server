Regex to play with the main list: /(.*?\t.*?\t.*?) \((.+?)\t/

ERROR IS IN THE DB
gendered pronouns (e.g quīdam): lack 'properties' attribute (same with numerals) (create property setter)
dexter, prosper: variants not listed (declension notes)
vicis: presentation is wrong (declension notes)
meminī, coepī: DB lacking correct perfect infinitive (fix in verb-property setter)
prosper, nēve ... nēve: brackets still present
-erī adjectives: feminine and neuter are wrong (tener, miser, līber, alter, asper)

Think about how to present their strange declension
alius: weird neuter (fix in NumPronProps)
laurus // dīves: genitivo cagado
salvē (sg.), salvēte (pl.): interjection but has plural
sponte (abl., gen. spontis very rare): presentation is all fubar'd
vīs (sg. only acc. vim, abl. vī; pl. vīrēs, -ium): all fubar'd

ERROR IS IN THE STATE AND PRESENTATION
irregular verbs: correct infinitive is not shown so cannot match; DOM-inserting it works
fās, nefās: wrong declension presentation (indeclinable)
singulī: presentation is wrong (DB is right)

ERROR IS IN THE ACTION
is/e adjectives: guess.declension not being set to true with any option (let alone the right one)
